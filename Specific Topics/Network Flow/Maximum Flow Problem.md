Given that flow network satisfies the capacity constraint and flow conservation properties, flow of a network is the total flow out of the source vertex.

- Equivalently, this is the same as the total flow into the target/sink vertex.

The maximum flow problem states:
- Given a flow network, determine the maximum value of the flow that can be sent from source S to sink T without violating the flow network properties.

There are some ways we can solve this:

- [[Ford Fulkerson Algorithm]]
- [[Min-Cut Max-Flow Theorem]] (Actually related to FF Algo)
