Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph.

G is a tree if:

- G is connected and acyclic (Has no cycles)
- G is connected and has V-1 edges (There is a minimum number of edges only)
- G is acyclic and has V-1 edges (There are no cycles and it has a minimum number of edges).
- G is acyclic, but a cycle is formed if any edge is added to G.
- G is connected, but would become disconnected if any single edge is removed from G.

If any of the above conditions are satisfied for an undirected graph G then G is a tree (And this would imply that all other conditions are met implicitly).
