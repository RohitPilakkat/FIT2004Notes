Making sure an algorithm does exact what you intend it to do.

Common method:
- Test them. Only shows that a program is wrong but cannot guarantee that it is always correct.

We can however prove that an algorithm is correct.
- Show that the program always terminates
- Show that the program produces correct results when it terminates.

Correctness of an algorithm can be proven by checking what the Loop Invariant is. If this loop invariant holds true during:
* Preprocessing
* Processing
* Termination
Then we can say that the algorithm is correct.
