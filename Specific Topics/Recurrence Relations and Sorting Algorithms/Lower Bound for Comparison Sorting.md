The lowest possible complexity any algorithm (known or unknown) can achieve to solve the problem.

Theoretical bound on what is best possible solution.
Unless stated otherwise, lower bound is for the worst-case complexity of the algorithm.

For [[Comparison Based Sorting]] our lower bound complexity is (NLogN). 

For [[Non-Comparison Based Sorting]] our lower bound can achieve lower than O(NLogN).
